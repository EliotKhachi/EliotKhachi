### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eliot Khachi. I'm currently working out of Canoga Park, California as a systems development and verification engineer for L3 Harris Technologies: Aerojet Rocketdyne. I focus on planning system integration tests for one of propulsion systems.

In my free time, I like to work on my personal coding projects and continue my AWS cloud certification journey in DevOps. Some of my other hobbies include working out, reading and skiing.
