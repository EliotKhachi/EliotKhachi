### Hello

My name is Eliot Khachi. I have 2 years of experience as an integration and test engineer in the aerospace industry. I focused on planning tests for a propulsion system to evaluate its performance and functionality against our customer's requirements. I am now exploring other avenues of engineering and opportunities therein.

In my free time, I like to work on personal coding projects, learn how to harness the AWS cloud, and stay up to date on what the future of technology has in store for humanity.  

I believe in the power of continuous learning and self-improvement. With that being said, some of my other hobbies include working out and reading.
