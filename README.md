### Hello

My name is Eliot Khachi. I'm currently working in Canoga Park, California as an integration and test engineer at L3 Harris Technologies: Aerojet Rocketdyne. As part of the systems development and verification team, I focus on planning tests for our propulsion system to evaluate its performance and functionality against our customer's requirements.

Outside of work, I like to work on my personal coding projects, continue my AWS cloud certification journey in DevOps, and stay up-to-date on the future of systems engineering, namely, model-based systems engineering.  

I believe in the power of continuous learning and self-improvement. With that being said, some of my other hobbies include working out and reading.
